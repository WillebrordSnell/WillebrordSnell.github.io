if I introduce it with this part from Brunelli, I can focus on Wong more clearly</em>. that's why careful researchers never put off writing until they've gathered all the data they need: they write from the strat of their projects to help them assemble their information in new ways.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>writing is to get your thoughts out of your head and onto paper, where you'll see what you really can think.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>in short, we write to remember more accurately, understander better, and evaluate what we think more objectively.(and as you will discover, the more you write, the better you read.)</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>you will understand your own work better when you try to anticipate your reads' inevitable and critical questions:How have you evaluated your evidence? Why do you think it's relevant? What ideas have you considered but reject?</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>all researchers, indlucing us, can recall moments when in writing to meet their readers' expectations, they found a flaw or blunder in their thinking or even discovered a new  insight that escaped them in fist draft written for themselves.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>we wish we could tell you how to balance your belief in the worth of your project with the need to accommodate the demands of teachers and colleagues, but we cannot. if you believe in what you're doing and cannot find anyone else who shares your beliefs, all you can do is put your head down and press on. with our admiration.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>those roles are worth thinking about from the beginning, before you write a word. if you ingore or miscast your readrers, you'll leave so many traces of mistake in your early drafts that you won't easily fix them in the final one.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>too many beginning researchers offer readers a relationship that caricatures a bad classroom: teacher, I know less than you. So my role is to show you how many facts I can dig up. yours to say whether I've found enough to give me a good grade. do that and your turn you project into a pointless drill that demeans both you and your teacher. worse, you cast yourself in a role excatly opposite that of a true researcher.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>in true research, you must switch the roles of student and teacher. when you do research, you learned something that others don't know. so when you report it, you must think of your reader as someone who doesn't know it but needs to and yourself ass someone who will give her reason to want to know it. you must imagine a relationship that gose beyond here are some facts I've dug up about fourteenth-century Tibetan weaving. are they enough of the right ones?</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>you establish your side of the relationship with your readres when you adopt one of those three roles— I have information for you; I can help you fix a problem; I can help you understand something better.and you must understand what they want and what they are in return willing and able to do for you.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>your teachers except you to report not just what you find, but what you can do with it.</strong></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>These scholars have invited you to talk about your specialty: the social history of zeppelin travel in the 1930s. They don’t want you just to amuse them with new facts (though they’ll be happy if you&nbsp;do) or to help them do something (though they’d be pleased if you got them consulting work with True- to- Life Films). They want you to use whatever new facts you have to help them better understand the social history of zeppelin travel or, better still, of lighter- than- air culture in general.</p>\\n<p>Because these lighter- than- air scholars are intensely committed to finding the Truth about zeppelins, you know they expect you to be objective, rigorously logical, and able to examine every issue from all sides. You also know that if you don’t nail down your facts, they’ll hammer you during the question period and if you don’t have good answers, slice you up afterward over the wine and cheese, not just to be contentious or even nasty (though some will be), but to get as close as they can to the Truth about zeppelins in the 1930s. If you offer new data, like Great- Uncle Otto’s photos, letter, and menu, they’ll be glad to see them, but they’ll want to know why they matter and might even question their authenticity</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Think about your readers from the start, knowing that you’ll understand them better as you work through your project. Answer these questions early on, then revisit them when you start planning and again when you revise.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Who will read my paper?</li>\\n<li>What do they expect me to do?</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\",\"autoDesc\":true}")
